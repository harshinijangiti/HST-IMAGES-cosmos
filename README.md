# HST IMAGES FOR KMOS CALOGUE
We investigate the colour composite images of HST data to classify the galaxies into merging
galaxies or isolated galaxies. For that purpose we have used 214 galaxy images of Cosmic Evo-
lution Survey of Hubble Space Telescope for K-band Multi-Object Spectrograph (KMOS) 3D
catalog. We have used 3 types of mosaics F125, F160 and F814 to create the color composite
HST images for given galaxies in KMOS Halpha catalog. This color composite images are then
investigated to find whether the galaxies are mergers or not
